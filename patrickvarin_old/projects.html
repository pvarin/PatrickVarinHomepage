                        Just because we can, four of us set fourth to design and build a mechanical hand with the ability to play rock-paper-scissors with an opponent. Not only does the device sense when you are making your move, but it recognizes your move and logs it in memory so that it can decide what to play next.

                        As the final deliverable for a Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) class, we studied the Shallow Water Equations, a derivative of the more famous Navier-Stokes Equations. Because the Shallow Water Equations are non-linear, and linearizing them destroys some of the more interesting behavior, we also explored various numerical methods for approximating solutions to PDEs.

                        This independant project culminated in a paper and a MATLAB simulation of a breaking dam. This simulation gives insight into the behavior of a body of water when a dam breaks, complete with shock waves, wakes, and eddies.

Two prompts were given outlining two open-ended problems and we were instructed to choose a prompt, solve the problem, and write a paper in 48 hours. This is the prompt we chose: <blockquote>In the game of basketball, a player scores three points by successfully making a shot from beyond the three point line, which is 6.2 meters away from the basket in international games, such as the Olympics.  Suppose a player in an Olympic basketball game is at the three point line standing at a point making an angle 45 degrees to the principal axes of the court.   What initial ball velocities and spins will result in a successful shot from this point?</blockquote>

                        <p>
                        We quickly decided that a MATLAB simulation was the way to go, and so we spent the next 48 hours looking up Olympic regulations, hacking away in MATLAB, and wishing that we had access to the wind tunnel to collect data that might complement our simulation.

                        <p>Stress was high, especially considering all of the <em>legitimate</em> school work that was being neglected, but apparently it was not all in vain. Perhaps the most ironic part of our victory is that Olin doesn't even offer a Physics degree. Engineers for the win!

                        <h3>Simulating Microvascular Development<span>Summer 2011</span></h3>
                        <p>
                        A summer research project at Olin College, we investigated the biological mechanisms that caused changes in the microvasculature and proposed a mathematical model to simulate the behavior of blood vessels under various conditions. This research was geared towards understanding the biological mechanisms involved in Hypertension, Diabetes and Obesity.
                        Short Description
                        </p>
<!--                        <img src="img/temp.png" />-->
                        <p>
                        The first summer of research, this project is part of a larger three-year grant awarded to Professors Alisha Sarang-Sieminski and John Geddes. This project involved developing a mathematical model to explain abnormal microvascular development in diseases such as Hypertension, Diabetes and Obesity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Four Olin students, including myself, sifted through hundreds of research papers and created a comprehensive map of the interplay between key biological systems involved in microvascular development (i.e., changes in the diameter and wall thickness of blood vessels). Much of the literature on the subject identified critical biological pathways that are altered in diseased vessels. Using this literature, and data published in research papers, we developed and partially validated a model for microvascular adaptation in diseases.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        This new model was developed within the structure of previous, well accepted, mathematical models for microvascular adaptation in normal, non-diseased, blood vessels. These original models, developed by the mathematician and physiologist pair Pries and Secomb, were phenomenological rather than mechanistic, that is they replicated the behavior of blood vessels without modeling the mechanisms that caused the phenomena. This project is an endeavor to capture the mechanisms involved in this process as well as the behavior of blood vessel adaptation.
