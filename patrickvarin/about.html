                    Hey there! Welcome to my site! This site began as an attempt to teach myself the basics of web programming: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For some reason in the process I decided that it would be a good idea to post my life on the internet for everyone to see. The result is this site, designed for the world's peering eyes. Come on in, enjoy! Learn what I'm all about.

                   I am a second semester sophomore at <a href="http://www.olin.edu/">Olin College</a>, enjoying every minute of it. I am doing my best to masquarade as a Physics major among Engineering majors. Alas, at an engineering school of ~320 the available degrees are limited to...well...engineering, which is why I took advantage of Olin's innovative nature and designed my own major, "Engineering with a concentration in Physics" (E:Physics for short), that satisfies all of the degree requirements of any other Physics degree. Conveniently enough Olin students can cross-register with <a href="http://web.wellesley.edu/web">Wellesley College</a> and <a href="http://www.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>, both of which <em>do</em> offer physics degrees. Here I can fill the degree requirements that Olin doesn't offer.

                   My interest in physics (and math, by association) probably stems from my love for theory. Theory can be <em>so beautiful</em> at times! There is little in the academic world that is more beautiful in its simplicity than Maxwell's Equations or Einstein's Theory of Relativity. I'll admit that the Standard Model of particle physics could use some cleaning up at the moment, but I have faith that we will come up with something.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                   In addition to physics, I am enthralled by every aspect of my studies at Olin. This small community has drawn me into many a crazy project, and allowed me to cultivate academic interests unrelated to physics: designing electrical and mechanical systems, programming, simulating, building. Engineering gives me an opportunity to manipulate the world, while physics provides a framework to understand it. I have found that there are few sensations more incredible then conceiving an idea and laboriously bringing it into fruition.	Olin has given me the incredible opportunity to mate my love of theory with the ability to tinker, create and invent!

                   <h2>Interests</h2>
                   I love creating things! Which may be the reason that I ended up at a small hands-on engineering school instead of another school with a larger physics program.

                   On a day to day basis I usually get myself caught in one insane project or another with my classmates at Olin.

                   <p>
                   During my sophomore year of high school I encountered one of the most influential people in my life, in the form of a high school physics teacher, Mr. Stimpert. In his class I fell in love with physics. An endeavor to understand the world on the most fundamental level...ohh it makes my spine shiver! Seriously though, I wish you could meet this guy. I am still pursuing this passion as an <abbr title="Engineering with a concentration in Physics, a self-designed major">E:Physics</abbr> major at Olin College.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                   I would have to say that high school was a pretty influential time. I taught myself to code and became the lead programmer on my <acronym title="For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology">FIRST Robotics team</acronym>, Team 1259. This and my insatiable passion for math have probably gotten me to where I am right now.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                   Outside of academics, I am incredibly captivated by the outdoors. Living in Wisconsin has taught me how to ski (as well as a few other essentials for surviving this wintertime tundra). Despite the cold winters, I must admit that it becomes beautiful in the spring and summer, and this is when I can set out backpacking! Now that I'm going to school so close to Vermont, I can take advantage of the White Mountains in all of their glory. Fortunately I have a couple friends at school that are crazy enough to accompany me into the wilderness!
